Arduino sketch for a Quiz system.

* Up to 4 players
* The first player to push his button wins the right to answer.
  Other players will be locked out until quiz master resets the lock.
* Buzzer sounds to notify when a player has won the right to answer.

I've run this on an Arduino Pro Mini 5V (from SparkFun).
